    Date Written:    4/9/2013
    Date Modified    7/23/2013 - renamed to Lab 9
                     4/2/2014  - renamed to lab 8
                     4/6/2015  - renamed to lab 10
                               - changed print to inOrderPrint
                     11/4/2015 - merged with Lab 5's RunTestLinkedBagWithString
                                 and now references Lab0809TestTreeGeneric

    NOTE:  for Lab 8, you are writing your own generic Tree<E>
    using your own generic BTNode<E>

    No changes to THIS file is needed for Lab 9 - just Lab0809TestTreeGeneric
